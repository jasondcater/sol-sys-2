These files are just to help me quickly process data from NASA's HORIZONS Web-Interface.

The "pluto_test_file.txt" is a text output from the NASA system.

These utilites are not integral to the Solar System model but I will leave them here incase you are interested in how to start processing the NASA data. You will probably want to customize your processing, but you can start here if need be.
