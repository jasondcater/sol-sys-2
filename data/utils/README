This util processes and normalizes the data,

Place JUST the csv lines from the ephemeris you wish to process into the file "dirty.csv"
The result will be placed into "clean.txt" which then can be added to "ephemeris.json"

The source data contains Julian Time stamps, regular dates, xyz vectors in scientific notation

The output (inside clean.txt), will be rows of data objects with the date as a key and xyz distances 
in Astronomical Units
